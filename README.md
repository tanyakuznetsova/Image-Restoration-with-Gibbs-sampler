# Image Restoration with Gibbs Sampler

This project explores the application of Gibbs sampling for image restoration. 
The goal is to denoise corrupted images using a Gibbs sampling algorithm. 
The implementation is done in Python with NumPy, OpenCV, and matplotlib. 
Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters for image restoration.
